# day-planner

## TODOs

### Planner display
- WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- Review event.preventDefault

### Interactivity
- WHEN I click into a timeblock THEN I can enter an event
- Use Git branching

### Storage
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
