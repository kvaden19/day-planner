# day-planner

## Description
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

I've created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

The app is built with HTML and CSS, using Bootstrap and Font Awesome for layout and icons.
The app is powered by JavaScript, jQuery, and Moment.js.

## Usage
The app can be accessed here: https://kvaden19.github.io/day-planner

When the user opens the app they will be greeted with the current day of week and date.

The page is populated with "timeblocks" for each hour beginning with 8:00 AM and ending with 6:00 PM. 
The timeblocks are color coded according to whether they are past (gray), current hour (red), or future (green).

The user can click on the color field of any timeblock and enter text.
They can then click the save button (disk icon) on the far right of the timeblock to save the event.
Timeblock text will persist on page refresh.
